\begin_layout Plain Layout
Quantum dots are good for microscopy because they are bright and photo-stable.
 LM cant really use them because they are difficult to controle.
 (Some recent publications in LM using QDs.
 Stress that LM is very accessible and cheap.) We try first to separate the
 individual sources and then localise them individually contraty to the
 fitting of the model of the PSF and intentistie to the time data.
 This accomodates the PSF of different shapes as no prior knowledge about
 hte PSF (apart from the non-negativity constraints) are used.

One of the issue is to estimate the number of components in the data.
 As this might result in differnet reconstruction (demonstration).

) control ON-OFF transition by photo-switching of the fluorophores as they
 require only one source to be ON within a diffraction limited area at a
 time.
 This is achieved by driving the sample into a state where only a small
 subset of the fluorophores are in ON state.
 The superresolution image is composed from the repetitive localisation
 of the different subsets of individual fluorophores.
 An optimal number of the ON sources in each acquisition frame must be experiman
tally estimated as a small density lead to a long acquistion time whereas
 a high density of the ON fluorophores results in overlapping sources that
 cannot be localised

 make QDs very attractive for biological research.
 However, the stochastic blinking makes QDs impractical for the standard
 LM as the rate of ON-OFF transition is difficult to control.
 This results in highly overlapping sources that cannot be localised with
 standard LM techniques.

Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 is a natural model for QD data.
 It decomposes spatio-temporal data - a movie of the blinking QDs - into
 a spatial component - images of the individual sources - and a temporal
 component - their fluctuating intensities.
 Unlike ICA, NMF imposes a natural non-negativity constraints on the images
 of the inidvidual sources (point spread function PSF) and their intensities.
 Moreover, we used a NMF algorith
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 that maximizes the likelihood of model for data corrupted with Poisson
 noise which makes it a method of choice compard to ICA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NMF does not put any constraints on the shpae or blinking behavior of the
 individual sources (apart from being non-negative).
 Therefore NMF can separate images overlapping fluorophores each having
 different shape and blinking behavior.
 This can, for example, arise in a 3D sample where sources can be in different
 focal depth.
 This results in variety of point spread function
