@article{Heintzmann2007,
abstract = {The ability of iteratively constrained maximum likelihood (ML) deconvolution to reconstruct out-of-band information is discussed and exemplified by simulations. The frequency dependent relative energy regain, a novel way of quantifying the reconstruction ability, is introduced. The positivity constraint of ML deconvolution allows reconstructing information outside the spatial frequency bandwidth which is set by the optical system. This is demonstrated for noise-free and noisy data. It is also shown that this property depends on the type of object under investigation. An object is constructed where no significant out-of-band reconstruction is possible. It is concluded that in practical situations the amount of possible out-of-band reconstruction depends on the agreement between reality and the model describing "typical objects" incorporated into the algorithm by appropriate penalty functions.},

@article{Kempen1997BA,
abstract = {In this paper, we compare the performance of three iterative methods for image restoration: the Richardson2013Lucy algorithm, the iterative constrained Tikhonov2013Miller algorithm (ICTM) and the Carrington algorithm. Both the ICTM and the Carrington algorithm are based on an additive Gaussian noise model, but differ in the way they incorporate the non-negativity constraint. Under low light-level conditions, this additive (Gaussian) noise model is a poor description of the actual photon-limited image recording, compared with that of a Poisson process. The Richardson2013Lucy algorithm is a maximum likelihood estimator for the intensity of a Poisson process. We have studied various methods for determining the regularization parameter of the ICTM and the Carrington algorithm and propose a (Gaussian) prefiltering to reduce the noise sensitivity of the Richardson2013Lucy algorithm. The results of these algorithms are compared on spheres convolved with a point spread function and distorted by Poisson noise. Our simulations show that the Richardson2013Lucy algorithm, with Gaussian prefiltering, produces the best result in most of the tests. Finally, we show an example of how restoration methods can improve quantitative analysis: the total amount of fluorescence inside a closed object is measured in the vicinity of another object before and after restoration.},

@article{Verveer1999,
abstract = {We have compared different image restoration approaches for fluorescence microscopy. The most widely used algorithms were classified with a Bayesian theory according to the assumed noise model and the type of regularization imposed. We considered both Gaussian and Poisson models for the noise in combination with Tikhonov regularization, entropy regularization, Good's roughness and without regularization (maximum likelihood estimation). Simulations of fluorescence confocal imaging were used to examine the different noise models and regularization approaches using the mean squared error criterion. The assumption of a Gaussian noise model yielded only slightly higher errors than the Poisson model. Good's roughness was the best choice for the regularization. Furthermore, we compared simulated confocal and wide-field data. In general, restored confocal data are superior to restored wide-field data, but given sufficient higher signal level for the wide-field data the restoration result may rival confocal data in quality. Finally, a visual comparison of experimental confocal and wide-field data is presented.},
