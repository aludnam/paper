abstract = {Superresolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging (SOFI) as initially demonstrated allows for a resolution enhancement in imaging by a factor of square-root of two. Here, we demonstrate how to increase the resolution of SOFI images by re-weighting the Optical Transfer Function (OTF). Furthermore, we demonstrate how cross-cumulants can be exploited to obtain a fair approximation of the underlying Point-Spread Function. We show a two-fold increase of resolution (over the diffraction limit) of near-infrared quantum dot labeled tubulin-network of 3T3 fibroblasts.},

abstract = {We have compared different image restoration approaches for fluorescence microscopy. The most widely used algorithms were classified with a Bayesian theory according to the assumed noise model and the type of regularization imposed. We considered both Gaussian and Poisson models for the noise in combination with Tikhonov regularization, entropy regularization, Good's roughness and without regularization (maximum likelihood estimation). Simulations of fluorescence confocal imaging were used to examine the different noise models and regularization approaches using the mean squared error criterion. The assumption of a Gaussian noise model yielded only slightly higher errors than the Poisson model. Good's roughness was the best choice for the regularization. Furthermore, we compared simulated confocal and wide-field data. In general, restored confocal data are superior to restored wide-field data, but given sufficient higher signal level for the wide-field data the restoration result may rival confocal data in quality. Finally, a visual comparison of experimental confocal and wide-field data is presented.},

abstract = {Rayleigh's criterion is extensively used in optical microscopy for determining the resolution of microscopes. This criterion imposes a resolution limit that has long been held as an impediment for studying nanoscale biological phenomenon through an optical microscope. However, it is well known that Rayleigh's criterion is based on intuitive notions. For example, Rayleigh's criterion is formulated in a deterministic setting that neglects the photon statistics of the acquired data. Hence it does not take into account the number of detected photons, which, in turn, raises concern over the use of Rayleigh's criterion in photon-counting techniques such as single-molecule microscopy. Here, we re-examine the resolution problem by adopting a stochastic framework and present a resolution measure that overcomes the limitations of Rayleigh's criterion. This resolution measure predicts that the resolution of optical microscopes is not limited and that it can be improved by increasing the number of detected photons. Experimental verification of the resolution measure is carried out by imaging single-molecule pairs with different distances of separation. The resolution measure provides a quantitative tool for designing and evaluating single-molecule experiments that probe biomolecular interactions.},

Self-interference of a point source's coherent point spread function with its inverted copy leads to a reduction in the integrated signal for off-axis sources compared to sources on the inversion axis. This can be used to enhance the resolution in a confocal laser scanning microscope. We present a simple image inversion interferometer relying solely on reflections off planar surfaces. Measurements of the detection point spread function for several types of light sources confirm the predicted performance and suggest its usability for scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy.},

abstract = {Super-resolution optical microscopy is a rapidly evolving area of fluorescence microscopy with a tremendous potential for impacting many fields of science. Several super-resolution methods have been developed over the last decade, all capable of overcoming the fundamental diffraction limit of light. We present here an approach for obtaining subdiffraction limit optical resolution in all three dimensions. This method relies on higher-order statistical analysis of temporal fluctuations (caused by fluorescence blinking/intermittency) recorded in a sequence of images (movie). We demonstrate a 5-fold improvement in spatial resolution by using a conventional wide-field microscope. This resolution enhancement is achieved in iterative discrete steps, which in turn allows the evaluation of images at different resolution levels. Even at the lowest level of resolution enhancement, our method features significant background reduction and thus contrast enhancement and is demonstrated on quantum dot-labeled microtubules of fibroblast cells.},

Our novel method relies on intense illumination to reversibly induce a very long-lived (>10 s) dark state from which single fluorochromes slowly return stochastically. As in other localization microscopy methods, reversible photobleaching microscopy localizes single fluorochromes, but has the advantage that specialized photoactivatible and photoswitchable molecules or special immersion/embedding media are not required.},

abstract = {Recent advances in far-field optical nanoscopy have enabled fluorescence imaging with a spatial resolution of 20 to 50 nanometers. Multicolor super-resolution imaging, however, remains a challenging task. Here, we introduce a family of photo-switchable fluorescent probes and demonstrate multicolor stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). Each probe consists of a photo-switchable "reporter" fluorophore that can be cycled between fluorescent and dark states, and an "activator" that facilitates photo-activation of the reporter. Combinatorial pairing of reporters and activators allows the creation of probes with many distinct colors. Iterative, color-specific activation of sparse subsets of these probes allows their localization with nanometer accuracy, enabling the construction of a super-resolution STORM image. Using this approach, we demonstrate multicolor imaging of DNA model samples and mammalian cells with 20- to 30-nanometer resolution. This technique will facilitate direct visualization of molecular interactions at the nanometer scale.},

abstract = {Biological structures span many orders of magnitude in size, but far-field visible light microscopy suffers from limited resolution. A new method for fluorescence imaging has been developed that can obtain spatial distributions of large numbers of fluorescent molecules on length scales shorter than the classical diffraction limit. Fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy (FPALM) analyzes thousands of single fluorophores per acquisition, localizing small numbers of them at a time, at low excitation intensity. To control the number of visible fluorophores in the field of view and ensure that optically active molecules are separated by much more than the width of the point spread function, photoactivatable fluorescent molecules are used, in this case the photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (PA-GFP). For these photoactivatable molecules, the activation rate is controlled by the activation illumination intensity; nonfluorescent inactive molecules are activated by a high-frequency (405-nm) laser and are then fluorescent when excited at a lower frequency. The fluorescence is imaged by a CCD camera, and then the molecules are either reversibly inactivated or irreversibly photobleached to remove them from the field of view. The rate of photobleaching is controlled by the intensity of the laser used to excite the fluorescence, in this case an Ar+ ion laser. Because only a small number of molecules are visible at a given time, their positions can be determined precisely; with only approximately 100 detected photons per molecule, the localization precision can be as much as 10-fold better than the resolution, depending on background levels. Heterogeneities on length scales of the order of tens of nanometers are observed by FPALM of PA-GFP on glass. FPALM images are compared with images of the same molecules by widefield fluorescence. FPALM images of PA-GFP on a terraced sapphire crystal surface were compared with atomic force microscopy and show that the full width at half-maximum of features approximately 86 +/- 4 nm is significantly better than the expected diffraction-limited optical resolution. The number of fluorescent molecules and their brightness distribution have also been determined using FPALM. This new method suggests a means to address a significant number of biological questions that had previously been limited by microscope resolution.},

abstract = {A variety of recent imaging techniques are able to beat the diffraction limit in fluorescence microcopy by activating and localizing subsets of the fluorescent molecules in the specimen, and repeating this process until all of the molecules have been imaged. In these techniques there is a tradeoff between speed (activating more molecules per imaging cycle) and error rates (activating more molecules risks producing overlapping images that hide information on molecular positions), and so intelligent image processing approaches are needed to identify and reject overlapping images. We introduce here a formalism for defining error rates, derive a general relationship between error rates, image acquisition rates, and the performance characteristics of the image processing algorithms, and show that there is a minimum acquisition time irrespective of algorithm performance. We also consider algorithms that can infer molecular positions from images of overlapping blurs, and derive the dependence of the minimum acquisition time on algorithm performance.},

abstract = {We present a novel microscopy technique to measure the scattered wavefront emitted from an optically transparent microscopic object. The complex amplitude is decoded via phase stepping in a common-path interferometer, enabling high mechanical stability. We demonstrate theoretically and practically that the incoherent summation of multiple illumination directions into a single image increases the resolving power and facilitates image reconstruction in diffraction tomography. We propose a slice-by-slice object-scatter extraction algorithm entirely based in real space in combination with ordinary z-stepping. Thereby the computational complexity affiliated with tomographic methods is significantly reduced. Using the first order Born approximation for weakly scattering objects it is possible to obtain estimates of the scattering density from the exitwaves.},

In recent years, however, several new far-field super-resolution imaging techniques have broken this diffraction limit, producing, for example, video-rate movies of synaptic vesicles in living neurons with 62 nm spatial resolution. Current research is focused on further improving spatial resolution in an effort to reach the goal of video-rate imaging of live cells with molecular (1-5 nm) resolution. Here, we describe the contributions of fluorescent probes to far-field super-resolution imaging, focusing on fluorescent proteins and organic small-molecule fluorophores.

Here, we describe the application of the 2CLM approach to the simultaneous nanoimaging of cellular structures using two fluorochrome types distinguished by different fluorescence emission wavelengths. The capabilities of 2CLM for studying the spatial organization of the genome in the mammalian cell nucleus are demonstrated for the relative distributions of two chromosomal proteins labeled with autofluorescent GFP and mRFP1 domains.

Measuring and then correcting for these inhomogeneities is the province of adaptive optics. Here we introduce an approach to adaptive optics in microscopy wherein the rear pupil of an objective lens is segmented into subregions, and light is directed individually to each subregion to measure, by image shift, the deflection faced by each group of rays as they emerge from the objective and travel through the specimen toward the focus. Applying our method to two-photon microscopy, we could recover near-diffraction-limited performance from a variety of biological and nonbiological samples exhibiting aberrations large or small and smoothly varying or abruptly changing. In particular, results from fixed mouse cortical slices illustrate our ability to improve signal and resolution to depths of 400 microm.},

One canonical example of a heterogeneously distributed membrane protein is hemagglutinin (HA) from influenza virus, which is associated with controversial cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. Using fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy, we are able to image distributions of tens of thousands of HA molecules with subdiffraction resolution ( approximately 40 nm) in live and fixed fibroblasts. HA molecules form irregular clusters on length scales from approximately 40 nm up to many micrometers, consistent with results from electron microscopy. In live cells, the dynamics of HA molecules within clusters is observed and quantified to determine an effective diffusion coefficient. The results are interpreted in terms of several established models of biological membranes.},

Using Monte Carlo simulations it is shown that estimation algorithms can come close to attaining the limit given in the expression. Explicit quantitative results are also provided to show how the limit of the localization accuracy is reduced by factors such as pixelation of the detector and noise sources in the detection system.

Here we describe how this method can be applied in three dimensions to double the axial as well as the lateral resolution, with true optical sectioning. A grating is used to generate three mutually coherent light beams, which interfere in the specimen to form an illumination pattern that varies both laterally and axially. The spatially structured excitation intensity causes normally unreachable high-resolution information to become encoded into the observed images through spatial frequency mixing. This new information is computationally extracted and used to generate a three-dimensional reconstruction with twice as high resolution, in all three dimensions, as is possible in a conventional wide-field microscope. The method has been demonstrated on both test objects and biological specimens, and has produced the first light microscopy images of the synaptonemal complex in which the lateral elements are clearly resolved.},

Here we present a new computational scheme for data processing consisting of noise reduction, detection of likely fluorophore positions, high-precision fluorophore localization and subsequent visualization of found fluorophore positions in a super-resolution image. We present and benchmark different algorithms for noise reduction and demonstrate the use of non-maximum suppression to quickly find likely fluorophore positions in high depth and very noisy images. The algorithm is evaluated and compared in terms of speed, accuracy and robustness by means of simulated data. On real biological samples, we find that real-time data processing is possible and that super-resolution imaging with organic fluorophores of cellular structures with approximately 20 nm optical resolution can be completed in less than 10 s.},

In the setup, the illumination pattern is generated by projecting a movable pinhole mask into the sample, and a wide-field fluorescence microscope image is acquired for each pattern position. The structured illumination data obtained from a two-dimensional illumination pattern can be treated by projection strategies such as in video confocal microscopy (sum, maximum, maximum minus minimum, and superconfocal), by a scaled subtraction of the out-of-focus estimate, or by a modified version of the Fourier-space treatment, as is known for data from one-dimensional structured illumination. We investigate the influence of some data processing strategies on unwanted effects such as residual patterning and local deviations from linearity in the reconstructed intensity.},

Illumination light is split by a grating and a beam splitter into six mutually coherent beams, three of which enter the specimen through each objective lens. The resulting illumination intensity pattern contains high spatial frequency components both axially and laterally. In addition, the emission is collected by both objective lenses coherently, and combined interferometrically on a single camera, resulting in a detection transfer function with axially extended support. These two effects combine to produce near-isotropic resolution. Experimental images of test samples and biological specimens confirm the theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {Fluorescent imaging microscopy has been an essential tool for biologists over many years, especially after the discovery of the green fluorescent protein and the possibility of tagging virtually every protein with it. In recent years dramatic enhancement of the level of detail at which a fluorescing structure of interest can be imaged have been achieved. We review classical and new developments in high-resolution microscopy, and describe how these methods have been used in biological research. Classical methods include widefield and confocal microscopy whereas novel approaches range from linear methods such as 4Pi, I(5) and structured illumination microscopy to non-linear schemes such as stimulated emission depletion and saturated structured illumination. Localization based approaches (e.g. PALM and STORM), near-field methods and total internal refraction microscopy are also discussed. As the terms 'resolution', 'sensitivity', 'sampling' and 'precision' are sometimes confused, we explain their clear distinction. Key concepts such as the point spread function and the Abbe limit, which are necessary for an in depth understanding of the presented methods, are described without requiring extensive mathematical training.},

@article{Lagerholm2006,
abstract = {A method is described that takes advantage of the intermittency ("blinking") in the fluorescence of quantum dots (QDs) to measure absolute positions of closely spaced QDs. The concept is that even if two QDs are separated by only tens of nanometers, the position of each QD is resolvable if the point spread function of each can be imaged independently of the other. In the case of QDs, this is possible if each QD separately blinks completely on and off during a time-lapse sequence. To demonstrate the principle of this method, time-lapse sequences of single blinking QDs were acquired and the centroids of the point spread functions determined. Images of the blinking QDs were then overlapped in software, pixel by pixel, generating a range of submicroscopic distances between QD pairs. Methods were developed for analyzing the overlapped time sequences of the QD pairs so that the positions of the QDs and the distances between them could be determined without prior knowledge of the single QD positions. We subsequently used this method to measure the end-to-end length of a 122-basepair double-stranded DNA fragment.},

The frequency dependent relative energy regain, a novel way of quantifying the reconstruction ability, is introduced. The positivity constraint of ML deconvolution allows reconstructing information outside the spatial frequency bandwidth which is set by the optical system. This is demonstrated for noise-free and noisy data. It is also shown that this property depends on the type of object under investigation. An object is constructed where no significant out-of-band reconstruction is possible. It is concluded that in practical situations the amount of possible out-of-band reconstruction depends on the agreement between reality and the model describing "typical objects" incorporated into the algorithm by appropriate penalty functions.},

abstract = {Estimating the location of single molecules from microscopy images is a key step in many quantitative single molecule data analysis techniques. Different algorithms have been advocated for the fitting of single molecule data, particularly the nonlinear least squares and maximum likelihood estimators. Comparisons were carried out to assess the performance of these two algorithms in different scenarios. Our results show that both estimators, on average, are able to recover the true location of the single molecule in all scenarios we examined. However, in the absence of modeling inaccuracies and low noise levels, the maximum likelihood estimator is more accurate than the nonlinear least squares estimator, as measured by the standard deviations of its estimates, and attains the best possible accuracy achievable for the sets of imaging and experimental conditions that were tested. Although neither algorithm is consistently superior to the other in the presence of modeling inaccuracies or misspecifications, the maximum likelihood algorithm emerges as a robust estimator producing results with consistent accuracy across various model mismatches and misspecifications. At high noise levels, relative to the signal from the point source, neither algorithm has a clear accuracy advantage over the other. Comparisons were also carried out for two localization accuracy measures derived previously. Software packages with user-friendly graphical interfaces developed for single molecule location estimation (EstimationTool) and limit of the localization accuracy calculations (FandPLimitTool) are also discussed.},

abstract = {Localization-based super resolution microscopy holds superior performances in live cell imaging, but its widespread use is thus far mainly hindered by the slow image analysis speed. Here we show a powerful image analysis method based on the combination of the maximum likelihood algorithm and a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Results indicate that our method is fast enough for real-time processing of experimental images even from fast EMCCD cameras working at full frame rate without compromising localization precision or field of view. This newly developed method is also capable of revealing movements from the images immediately after data acquisition, which is of great benefit to live cell imaging.},

@article{Gustafsson2005,
abstract = {Contrary to the well known diffraction limit, the fluorescence microscope is in principle capable of unlimited resolution. The necessary elements are spatially structured illumination light and a nonlinear dependence of the fluorescence emission rate on the illumination intensity. As an example of this concept, this article experimentally demonstrates saturated structured-illumination microscopy, a recently proposed method in which the nonlinearity arises from saturation of the excited state. This method can be used in a simple, wide-field (nonscanning) microscope, uses only a single, inexpensive laser, and requires no unusual photophysical properties of the fluorophore. The practical resolving power is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio, which in turn is limited by photobleaching. Experimental results show that a 2D point resolution of <50 nm is possible on sufficiently bright and photostable samples.},

abstract = {Recent advances in far-field fluorescence microscopy have led to substantial improvements in image resolution, achieving a near-molecular resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the two lateral dimensions. Three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale-resolution imaging, however, remains a challenge. We demonstrated 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) by using optical astigmatism to determine both axial and lateral positions of individual fluorophores with nanometer accuracy. Iterative, stochastic activation of photoswitchable probes enables high-precision 3D localization of each probe, and thus the construction of a 3D image, without scanning the sample. Using this approach, we achieved an image resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the lateral dimensions and 50 to 60 nanometers in the axial dimension. This development allowed us to resolve the 3D morphology of nanoscopic cellular structures.},

Green- and red-emitting fluorophores are selectively excited and quenched using dedicated beam pairs. The stimulated emission depletion beams deliver a lateral resolution of <30 nm and 65 nm for the green and the red color channel, respectively. The approximately 5 nm alignment accuracy of the two images establishes the precision with which differently labeled proteins are correlated in space. Colocalized nanoscopy is demonstrated with endosomal protein patterns and by resolving nanoclusters of a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, Tom20, in relation with the F(1)F(0)ATP synthase. The joint improvement of resolution and colocalization demonstrates the emerging potential of far-field fluorescence nanoscopy to study the spatial organization of macromolecules in cells.},

The sample is illuminated with a series of excitation light patterns, which cause normally inaccessible high-resolution information to be encoded into the observed image. The recorded images are linearly processed to extract the new information and produce a reconstruction with twice the normal resolution. Unlike confocal microscopy, the resolution improvement is achieved with no need to discard any of the emission light. The method produces images of strikingly increased clarity compared to both conventional and confocal microscopes.},

@article{Ventalon2005,
abstract = {We present a simple modification to a conventional wide-field fluorescence microscope that provides depth discrimination in thick tissues. The technique consists of illuminating a sample with a sequence of independent speckle patterns and displaying the rms of the resultant sequence of fluorescence images. The advantage of speckle illumination is that it provides diffraction-limited illumination granularity that is highly contrasted even in scattering media. We demonstrate quasi-confocal imaging in a mouse olfactory bulb labeled with green fluorescent protein.},
