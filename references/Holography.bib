@article{Grier2006,
abstract = {Holographic optical tweezers use computer-generated holograms to create arbitrary three-dimensional configurations of single-beam optical traps that are useful for capturing, moving, and transforming mesoscopic objects. Through a combination of beam-splitting, mode-forming, and adaptive wavefront correction, holographic traps can exert precisely specified and characterized forces and torques on objects ranging in size from a few nanometers to hundreds of micrometers. Offering nanometer-scale spatial resolution and real-time reconfigurability, holographic optical traps provide unsurpassed access to the microscopic world and have found applications in fundamental research, manufacturing, and materials processing.},

abstract = {Holographic optical traps use the forces exerted by computer-generated holograms to trap, move and otherwise transform mesoscopically textured materials. This article introduces methods for optimizing holographic optical traps' efficiency and accuracy, and an optimal statistical approach for characterizing their performance. This combination makes possible real-time adaptive optimization.},
