@article{Sieber2006,
abstract = {In the plasma membrane, syntaxin 1 and syntaxin 4 clusters define sites at which secretory granules and caveolae fuse, respectively. It is widely believed that lipid phases are mandatory for cluster formation, as cluster integrity depends on cholesterol. Here we report that the native lipid environment is not sufficient for correct syntaxin 1 clustering and that additional cytoplasmic protein-protein interactions, primarily involving the SNARE motif, are required. Apparently no specific cofactors are needed because i), clusters form equally well in nonneuronal cells, and ii), as revealed by nanoscale subdiffraction resolution provided by STED microscopy, the number of clusters directly depends on the syntaxin 1 concentration. For syntaxin 4 clustering the N-terminal domain and the linker region are also dispensable. Moreover, clustering is specific because in both cluster types syntaxins mutually exclude one another at endogenous levels. We suggest that the SNARE motifs of syntaxin 1 and 4 mediate specific syntaxin clustering by homooligomerization, thereby spatially separating sites for different biological activities. Thus, syntaxin clustering represents a mechanism of membrane patterning that is based on protein-protein interactions.},

@article{Chen2002,
abstract = {During neurotransmitter release, the neuronal SNARE proteins synaptobrevin/VAMP, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 form a four-helix bundle, the SNARE complex, that pulls the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes together possibly causing membrane fusion. Complexin binds tightly to the SNARE complex and is essential for efficient Ca(2+)-evoked neurotransmitter release. A combined X-ray and TROSY-based NMR study now reveals the atomic structure of the complexin/SNARE complex. Complexin binds in an antiparallel alpha-helical conformation to the groove between the synaptobrevin and syntaxin helices. This interaction stabilizes the interface between these two helices, which bears the repulsive forces between the apposed membranes. These results suggest that complexin stabilizes the fully assembled SNARE complex as a key step that enables the exquisitely high speed of Ca(2+)-evoked neurotransmitter release.},

@article{Rickman2010,
abstract = {The spatial distribution of the target (t-)SNARE proteins (syntaxin and SNAP-25) on the plasma membrane has been extensively characterized. However, the protein conformations and interactions of the two t-SNAREs in situ remain poorly defined. By using super-resolution optical techniques and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, we observed that within the t-SNARE clusters syntaxin and SNAP-25 molecules interact, forming two distinct conformations of the t-SNARE binary intermediate. These are spatially segregated on the plasma membrane with each cluster exhibiting predominantly one of the two conformations, representing the two- and three-helical forms previously observed in vitro. We sought to explain why these two t-SNARE intermediate conformations exist in spatially distinct clusters on the plasma membrane. By disrupting plasma membrane lipid order, we found that all of the t-SNARE clusters now adopted a single conformational state corresponding to the three helical t-SNARE intermediates. Together, our results define spatially distinct t-SNARE intermediate states on the plasma membrane and how the conformation adopted can be patterned by the underlying lipid environment.},

@article{Lang2007,
abstract = {The original 'lipid raft' hypothesis proposed that lipid-platforms/rafts form in the exoplasmic plasmalemmal leaflet by tight clustering of sphingolipids and cholesterol. Their physical state, presumably similar to liquid-ordered phases in model membranes, would confer detergent resistance to rafts and enriched proteins therein. Based on this concept, detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) from solubilized cells were considered to reflect pre-existing 'lipid rafts' in live cells. To date, more than 200 proteins were found in DRMs including also members of the SNARE superfamily, which are small membrane proteins involved in intracellular fusion steps. Their raft association indicates that they are not uniformly distributed, and, indeed, microscopic studies revealed that SNAREs concentrate in submicrometre-sized, cholesterol-dependent clusters at which vesicles fuse. However, the idea that SNARE clusters are 'lipid rafts' was challenged, as they do not colocalize with raft markers, and SNAREs are excluded from liquid-ordered phases in model membranes. Independent from this disagreement, in recent years the solubilization criterion has been criticized for several reasons, calling for a more exact definition of rafts. At a recent consensus on a revised raft model, the term 'lipid rafts' was replaced by 'membrane rafts' that were defined as 'small (10-200 nm), heterogeneous, highly dynamic, sterol- and sphingolipid-enriched domains that compartmentalize cellular processes'. As a result, after dismissing the terms 'detergent resistant' and 'liquid-ordered', it now appears that SNARE clusters are bona fide 'membrane rafts'.},

@article{Rickman2007,
abstract = {Eukaryotic membrane trafficking is a conserved process under tight temporal and spatial regulation in which the fusion of membranes is driven by the formation of the ternary SNARE complex. Syntaxin 1a, a core component of the exocytic SNARE complex in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, is regulated directly by munc18-1, its cognate Sec1p/munc18 (SM) protein. SM proteins show remarkable structural conservation throughout evolution, indicating a common binding mechanism and function. However, SM proteins possess disparate binding mechanisms and regulatory effects with munc18-1, the major brain isoform, classed as atypical in both its binding specificity and its mode. We now show that munc18-1 interacts with syntaxin 1a through two mechanistically distinct modes of binding, both in vitro and in living cells, in contrast to current models. Furthermore, these functionally divergent interactions occur at distinct cellular locations. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the multiple, spatially distinct roles of munc18-1.},
