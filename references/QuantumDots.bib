@article{Walling2009,
abstract = {In the past few decades, technology has made immeasurable strides to enable visualization, identification, and quantitation in biological systems. Many of these technological advancements are occurring on the nanometer scale, where multiple scientific disciplines are combining to create new materials with enhanced properties. The integration of inorganic synthetic methods with a size reduction to the nano-scale has lead to the creation of a new class of optical reporters, called quantum dots. These semiconductor quantum dot nanocrystals have emerged as an alternative to organic dyes and fluorescent proteins, and are brighter and more stable against photobleaching than standard fluorescent indicators. Quantum dots have tunable optical properties that have proved useful in a wide range of applications from multiplexed analysis such as DNA detection and cell sorting and tracking, to most recently demonstrating promise for in vivo imaging and diagnostics. This review provides an in-depth discussion of past, present, and future trends in quantum dot use with an emphasis on in vivo imaging and its related applications.},

abstract = {Fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have several unique optical and chemical features. These features make them desirable fluorescent tags for cell and developmental biological applications that require long-term, multi-target and highly sensitive imaging. The improved synthesis of water-stable QDs, the development of approaches to label cells efficiently with QDs, and improvements in conjugating QDs to specific biomolecules have triggered the recent explosion in their use in biological imaging. Although there have been many successes in using QDs for biological applications, limitations remain that must be overcome before these powerful tools can be used routinely by biologists.},

Owing to their optical, chemical and biofunctional properties, semiconductor quantum dot (QD) probes promise to be tools of choice in this endeavor. Here we review recent advances that allow ever more controlled experiments at the single-nanoparticle level in live cells. Several examples, related to membrane dynamics, cell signaling or intracellular transport, illustrate how single QD tracking can be readily used to decipher complex biological processes and address key concepts that underlie cellular organization and dynamics.},

@article{Wang2009,
abstract = {The photoluminescence from a variety of individual molecules and nanometre-sized crystallites is defined by large intensity fluctuations, known as 'blinking', whereby their photoluminescence turns 'on' and 'off' intermittently, even under continuous photoexcitation. For semiconductor nanocrystals, it was originally proposed that these 'off' periods corresponded to a nanocrystal with an extra charge. A charged nanocrystal could have its photoluminescence temporarily quenched owing to the high efficiency of non-radiative (for example, Auger) recombination processes between the extra charge and a subsequently excited electron-hole pair; photoluminescence would resume only after the nanocrystal becomes neutralized again. Despite over a decade of research, completely non-blinking nanocrystals have not been synthesized and an understanding of the blinking phenomenon remains elusive. Here we report ternary core/shell CdZnSe/ZnSe semiconductor nanocrystals that individually exhibit continuous, non-blinking photoluminescence. Unexpectedly, these nanocrystals strongly photoluminesce despite being charged, as indicated by a multi-peaked photoluminescence spectral shape and short lifetime. To model the unusual photoluminescence properties of the CdZnSe/ZnSe nanocrystals, we softened the abrupt confinement potential of a typical core/shell nanocrystal, suggesting that the structure is a radially graded alloy of CdZnSe into ZnSe. As photoluminescence blinking severely limits the usefulness of nanocrystals in applications requiring a continuous output of single photons, these non-blinking nanocrystals may enable substantial advances in fields ranging from single-molecule biological labelling to low-threshold lasers.},

@article{Lagerholm2006,
abstract = {A method is described that takes advantage of the intermittency ("blinking") in the fluorescence of quantum dots (QDs) to measure absolute positions of closely spaced QDs. The concept is that even if two QDs are separated by only tens of nanometers, the position of each QD is resolvable if the point spread function of each can be imaged independently of the other. In the case of QDs, this is possible if each QD separately blinks completely on and off during a time-lapse sequence. To demonstrate the principle of this method, time-lapse sequences of single blinking QDs were acquired and the centroids of the point spread functions determined. Images of the blinking QDs were then overlapped in software, pixel by pixel, generating a range of submicroscopic distances between QD pairs. Methods were developed for analyzing the overlapped time sequences of the QD pairs so that the positions of the QDs and the distances between them could be determined without prior knowledge of the single QD positions. We subsequently used this method to measure the end-to-end length of a 122-basepair double-stranded DNA fragment.},

One of the most exciting, yet also controversial, advances in label technology is the emerging development of quantum dots (QDs)--inorganic nanocrystals with unique optical and chemical properties but complicated surface chemistry--as in vitro and in vivo fluorophores. Here we compare and evaluate the differences in physicochemical properties of common fluorescent labels, focusing on traditional organic dyes and QDs. Our aim is to provide a better understanding of the advantages and limitations of both classes of chromophores, to facilitate label choice and to address future challenges in the rational design and manipulation of QD labels.},
