NMF in LM





  Introduction

Localisation microscopy (LM) is a conceptually simple and 
accessible technique providing super-resolution fluorescent 
images[Hess2006, Huang2008, Linde2008, Jones2011]. The structure 
of the sample is reconstructed by localising individual 
fluorophores with precision surpassing [Ober2004] the classical 
resolution limit. \delta=0.61\frac{\lambda}{\mbox{NA}}, where \lambda
 is the wavelength of the emission light and \mbox{NA} is the 
numerical aperture of the objective lens. LM makes use of the 
fluorophore transition between bright (ON) and dark (OFF) states 
to discriminate individual sources separated by a distance d<\delta
. Super-resolution is achieved by a repetitive localisation of 
the different individual spatially separated subsets of 
fluorophores. The number of ON sources in each acquisition frame 
must be optimised experimentally[Small2009]. A high density of 
the ON fluorophores results in overlapping sources and 
complicates localisation whereas a small density leads to a long 
acquisition time. Standard LM techniques (fPALM [Hess2006], STORM 
[Rust2006]) control the density of the ON sources by 
photo-switching. However, some recent research suggests 
algorithms which can deal with a high density of ON sources[Holden2011]
. 

Quantum dots (QD) are an order of magnitude brighter compared to 
the organic dyes used in conventional LM [Jaiswal2004, Resch-Genger2008]
. Under continuous excitation the QDs exhibit a stochastic 
blinking between ON and OFF states [Stefani2009]. Excellent 
photo-stability, low cyto-toxicity and distinctive spectral 
properties make QDs very attractive for biological research[Resch-Genger2008]
. However, the stochastic blinking of QDs is impractical for 
standard LM because the rate of ON-OFF transitions and hence the 
density of ON sources is difficult to control. QD labeled data 
typically consist of highly overlapping sources which cannot be 
localised with standard LM techniques.

Some methods exploiting the blinking behaviour of the QDs have 
been proposed, such as maximum a-posteriori (MAP) fitting of the 
positions and the intensities of known point spread functions 
(PSFs) to blinking QD[Harrington2008], independent component 
analysis (ICA) of the QD[Lidke2005] or resolution improvement by 
analysis of the intensity fluctuation (SOFI) has been 
demonstrated[Dertinger2010b].

  NMF



We used non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) [Lee1999] as a 
natural model for QD data. NMF decomposes a movie of the blinking 
QDs into spatial and temporal parts (i.e. time independent 
emission profiles of the individual sources and fluctuating 
intensities of each emitter, respectively). NMF imposes natural 
non-negativity constraints on both the spatial and the temporal 
components. Moreover, we used the NMF algorithm[Lee2001] which 
maximises the likelihood of the model for data corrupted with 
Poisson noise. This makes NMF preferable to ICA [Lidke2005] for 
QD data because ICA allows negative entries in the separated 
components and does not account for noise in the measured data 
(fig.[fig:Comparison of NMF and ICA]). 

NMF does not put any additional constraints on the shape (point 
spread function PSF) or blinking behaviour of the individual 
sources, apart from being non-negative. Therefore NMF can 
separate overlapping sources of differing shapes and blinking 
characteristics. Variability in PSFs can, for example, arise in a 
3D sample where fluorophores can be in different focal depths and 
therefore each exhibiting a unique PSF.

  Model comparison



The NMF algorithm requires prior knowledge about the number of 
sources K to be separated. Principal component analysis of the 
data (PCA) can be used as a simple method for dimensionality 
estimation. However, for noisy data the estimation of K is 
difficult. 

The results of NMF are the maximum-likelihood estimates, and 
therefore a higher K leads to a higher likelihood (or a lower 
residual error) as more sources are better able to fit the data. 
However, overestimating K produces spurious sources. On the other 
hand, underestimation of K results in incorrect source shapes as 
one component must fit several sources. Therefore a reliable 
estimation of K is vital for a successful separation.

The posterior distribution p(K|{\bf D}) represents evidence for a 
particular value of K given a data set {\bf D}. A lower bound for 
this quantity can be estimated by Bayesian treatment of the 
probabilistic NMF formulation [Canny2004, Buntine2006]. We can 
then choose the K which maximises the lower bound on p(K|{\bf D})
. However, a test on simulated data suggests that this approach 
systematically underestimates K. (Details in supplementary 
materials.)

An alternative approach is to analyse the residuals (difference 
between data and estimated model) for models with different K. 
Models with low K give rise to correlations in residuals because 
multiple individual emitters have to be represented with fewer 
components. Correlations decrease with higher K. We selected the 
smallest K which reduces the residual correlations to a certain 
level. Simulations suggest that this approach can provide more 
reliable estimation of K compared to the variational lower bound 
method. (Details in supplementary materials.)

  Results

Tests on simulated data with different densities of ten QDs 
suggests (see supplementary materials) that the analysis of the 
residuals in correlations provides the most accurate estimate of 
the number of sources K. We used this method in further 
computations. 

Simulations of noisy data comprising two QDs show that NMF can 
reliably separate two close emitters (d>\delta/10) when K_{\mbox{true}}
 is known (K=K_{\mbox{true}}). However, the ability to estimate K 
correctly becomes increasingly difficult for closely spaced 
sources. The high correlations in residuals for K<K_{\mbox{true}} 
arise only when the two sources are separated by at least d>\delta/5
, where \delta=0.61\lambda/\mbox{NA} is the classical resolution 
limit (fig. [fig:Localisation precision and maximum correlations]
). 

  Out of focus PSF

NMF can extract individual sources with differing shape because 
apart from the non-negativity there are no further constraints on 
the separated components. We show a separation of overlapping 
out-of-focus point spread functions (PSF) from a movie (10^{3} 
frames) of several blinking QDs (fig. [fig:Real-QD-data.]). 
Individual emitters were in slightly different focal depths and 
therefore each QD produced a distinctive PSF. As can be seen from 
fig.[fig:Real-QD-data.] individual PSFs were highly overlapping 
in each frame. 

The number of components was estimated from the analysis of the 
correlations in residual (fig.[fig:real QD - K estimation]). 

NMF was able to recover images of individual sources which 
correspond to realistic out-of-focus PSFs (fig. [fig:Real-QD-data.]
). It also recovered sources with PSFs only partially present in 
the selected region. 

  Discussion

We have demonstrated that NMF allows to separate individual 
emitters from a movie of blinking QDs. The ability to recover 
PSFs with different shapes from the data with highly overlapping 
sources makes the method attractive for imaging of 3D samples 
where fluorophores can be in different focal depths and therefore 
produce a variety of different PSFs. Diversity in PSFs for 
individual sources can also arise with aberrations in the optical 
system. 

Reliable estimation of the number of sources is important for 
correct recovery of individual components. This is a difficult 
task for data with a high density of overlapping sources. We 
demonstrated on simulated data the limitations this imposes on 
resolution of the method.

NMF allows localisation microscopy with blinking QDs, however, 
NMF is not limited to QDs only. It can separate any source with 
intermittent intensity as long as the actual fluorophores remain 
static in space during the acquisition period. A typical data set 
consists of 10^{3} frames and therefore the acquisition time is 
typically in order of tens of seconds. During this period the 
sample must remain still. This is a common limiting factor for 
localisation microscopy techniques. However, as NMF can separate 
overlapping sources it can speed up the acquisition compared to 
the standard LM techniques[Small2009]. Moreover the possibility 
of using QDs can make the exposure time shorter because QDs are 
usually brighter than common organic fluorophores used in LM.

NMF does not take into account the temporal structure of the 
data. Time frames can be permuted without affecting the separated 
components. However, there is a clear temporal structure in QDs 
blinking - the periods of ON and OFF times. Exploiting this 
information would likely facilitate the factorisation and will be 
a subject to further research.

  NMF model of the blinking QDs

A movie of blinking quantum dots can be regarded as an N\times T 
data matrix {\bf D} where N is the number of pixels and T is the 
number of time frames in the movie. Each frame in the movie is 
transformed into a column of the matrix {\bf D} by concatenating 
columns of the 2D image into a N\times1 vector. Non-negative 
matrix factorisation (NMF) makes an approximative decomposition {\bf D}\approx{\bf WH},
where the N\times T matrix {\bf D} is expressed as a 
multiplication of the N\times K matrix {\bf W} and K\times T 
matrix {\bf H}, subject to non-negativity constraints on the 
entries w_{nk}\geq0 and h_{kt}\geq0. Each column \bm{w}_{k} of 
the matrix {\bf W} (a N\times1 vector) then represents an image 
of the kth source and each row \bm{h}_{k} of the matrix {\bf H} (1\times T
 vector) represents the time profile of the kth source intensity.

The NMF algorithm [Lee2001] makes the decomposition [eq:NMF approximative]
 such that the likelihood function of the model is maximised 
under assumption of Poisson noise. The approximative 
factorisation [eq:NMF approximative] can then be written as \mathbb{E}\left[{\bf D}\right]={\bf WH},
where \mathbb{E}\left[.\right] denotes expectation value of the 
noisy data with respect to the Poisson distribution.

  NMF updates 

We used iterative NMF updates[Lee2001] to compute the 
factorisation [eq:NMF relaxed]w_{nk}where the `./' operation 
refers to an element-wise division. The matrix elements w_{nk} 
and h_{kt} were initialised at random from the uniform 
distribution. The columns of the matrix {\bf W} were normalised 
such that \sum_{n}w_{nk}=1. One component was added as a 
homogeneous, static background: w_{n(K+1)}=\frac{1}{N}, h_{(K+1)t}=Nb
, where the background value b was estimated from the dark 
regions of the data averaged over time \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t}d_{nt}. 
This component was not updated over the iterations. We run each 
NMF evaluation with five partial restarts - after each run 
converges we restarted the values of w_{nk} and run the updates 
for both {\bf W} and {\bf H} again. The new result is accepted if 
the likelihood function increases. This procedure helps to reach 
a better local minimum. 

  Gamma-Poisson model

The gamma-Poisson (GaP) model has been proposed as a 
probabilistic model for NMF[Canny2004]. The entries h_{kt} of the 
intensity matrix {\bf H} are regarded as latent variables 
generated from a Gamma distribution with parameters \alpha_{k},\ \beta_{k}
 and the data are modelled as a Poisson variable with mean {\bf WH}
 as in [eq:NMF relaxed]. Variables \theta=\{\bm{w}_{k},\alpha_{k},\beta_{k},\, k=1..K\}
 are then parameters of the GaP model. The variational 
approximation of the GaP model[Buntine2006] provides a lower 
bound \mathcal{L} on the likelihood function p({\bf D}|K,\theta) 
with latent variables \bm{h}_{k} integrated out. We can express 
the posterior distribution p(K|{\bf D})\propto p({\bf D}|K)p(K) 
where p(K) is a prior distribution over values of K and p({\bf D}|K)=\int p({\bf D}|\theta,K)p(\theta|K)d\theta
 is a marginal likelihood.

  Correlations in residuals

The true number of components K_{\mbox{true}} can also be 
estimated from the N\times T residual matrix \bm{S} (entries s_{xt}
). After evaluating the model [eq:NMF relaxed] for a specific K, 
we compute a standardised residual matrix with entries s_{nt}=\frac{d_{nt}-\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{nk}h_{kt}}{\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{nk}h_{kt}}}.
The factor 1/\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{nk}h_{kt}} is applied in 
order to standardise the residuals (zero mean and unit variance) 
of Poisson distributed data. We can then compute the N\times N 
correlation matrix \bm{C}_{S}=\bm{SS}^{T},and the N\times N 
matrix of the correlation coefficients \bm{R}_{S} with entries r_{ij}=\frac{c_{ij}}{\sqrt{c_{ii}c_{jj}}}.

Underestimation of the number of sources (K<K_{\mbox{true}}) will 
lead to correlations between some pixels as the model will try to 
explain multiple sources with one component. For K\geq K_{\mbox{true}}
 the correlations are expected to drop to a base level and the 
residuals become uncorrelated. We can pick up the value of K=\hat{K}
 for which the residual correlations decrease to a certain level 
and K>\hat{K} does not give any further improvement. 

  Simulated data<sub:Simulated-data>

The parameters used for simulations are shown in table [tab:Parameters-of-the-simulation]
. The individual QDs were generated as in-focus point-spread 
functions and the intensity of each source was generated from 
uniform distribution on the interval \left[0,\, I_{max}\right]. A 
uniform constant background was added to each frame and all 
pixels were corrupted with Poisson noise. 

We generated two different collections of data-sets. In the first 
collection we simulated two sources (K_{\mbox{true}}=2) separated 
by a distance d=0.1\mbox{ to }1.2\mbox{ pixels}. In the second 
collection we simulated ten sources (K_{\mbox{true}}=10) randomly 
distributed within a circular area with diameter r=\delta,\,1.5\delta
 and 2\delta, where \delta=0.61\frac{\lambda}{\mbox{NA}} is the 
classical resolution limit. Each dataset in both collections was 
generated 10 times with a random geometric configuration of the 
individual sources.

  Estimation of K

We compared the performance of the the variational approximation 
of GaP model and the analysis of the residual correlations in K 
estimation task. We used simulated data comprising 10 sources (K_{\mbox{true}}=10
). The mean image of the data with three different densities of 
sources is shown in the first line of fig.[fig: estimation of K by variational lower bound and maximum correlation]
. We generated data with 10 random geometric configuration for 
each density. The first 18 principal components (PC) eigenvalues 
for three different random configurations are plotted in the 
second row of fig.[fig: estimation of K by variational lower bound and maximum correlation]
. For sparse data (left column) we can estimate the number of 
components from the `kink' in the spectrum of PC eigenvalues at K=10
. However, for dense data (right) this estimation is impossible 
to make because the PC eigenvalues drop very gradually. 

The variational lower bound for models with different K for three 
different geometric configuration of the sources is plotted in 
the third line of fig.[fig: estimation of K by variational lower bound and maximum correlation]
. The lower bound peaks at the correct K=K_{\mbox{true}} for 
sparse data set (left), but for the denser data (right) it tends 
to reach the maximum for K<K_{\mbox{true}}. The variational lower 
bound systematically underestimates the value of K.

The maximum correlation coefficient [eq:Correlation in residuals] 
in residuals \max_{i,j}(r_{ij}) is shown in the last line of fig.[fig: estimation of K by variational lower bound and maximum correlation]
. The model was estimated using the NMF updates[eq:NMF updates Lee 2001]
. Values for three different configurations are shown. We can 
pick the K were the `kink' occurs.

A histogram of estimated K for both methods is shown in fig.[fig:Histogram: Maximum-correlations-in]
. The analyses of the maximum residual correlation provides a 
better estimate for K.

We used the simulated data of two QDs (K_{\mbox{true}}=2) 
separated by d=0.1\mbox{ to }1.2\mbox{ pixels} to evaluated the 
model for K=1,\,2 and 3 and analysed the residual correlations 
eq.[eq:Correlation in residuals]. The maximum value \max_{i,j}(r_{ij})
 in the correlation coefficient matrix [eq:Correlation in residuals]
 as a function of d is shown in fig.[fig:Localisation precision and maximum correlations]
 for the three different values of K. For closely spaced sources 
(d\leq30\mbox{ nm)} the correlations are approximately on the 
same level for any K. However, for d\geq40\mbox{ nm} there is a 
steep increase of the correlations for K=1 (blue line) compared 
to K=2 (green line). The model with K=3 (red line) does not lead 
to any further improvement. For this noise level we can therefore 
estimate the correct K=2 for emitters separated by at least d>50\mbox{ nm}
.

  Localisation error

To asses the localisation performance of NMF we used dataset of 
two QDs (K_{\mbox{true}}=2) separated by d and assumed that the 
number of sources is known K=K_{\mbox{true}}. Sources were 
localised as a maximum likelihood fit of an isotropic 2D gaussian 
with a centre \bm{\hat{x}}_{k} to the separated components \bm{w}_{k}
. We computed the mean relative localisation error as\varepsilon=\frac{1}{d}\frac{e_{1}+e_{2}}{2}
where e_{k}=\left|\bm{\hat{x}}_{k}-\bm{x}_{k}^{\mbox{true}}\right|
 corresponds to the localisation error of the kth source located 
at \bm{x}_{k}^{true} and d=\left|\bm{x}_{1}^{\mbox{true}}-\bm{x}_{2}^{\mbox{true}}\right|
 is the true separation of the emitters. The estimated \varepsilon
 for different values of d is shown as a magenta line in fig.[fig:Localisation precision and maximum correlations]
. For d>30\mbox{ nm} the mean localisation error is less than 20\%
 of the separation d (\varepsilon=0.2) and is further decreasing 
for higher values of d. 

Comparison with with the maximum residual correlation curves 
(blue, green, red in fig.[fig:Localisation precision and maximum correlations]
) shows that the determining factor for resolution of the method 
is the ability to estimate K correctly (here for d>50\mbox{ nm}). 

  Real samples

A solution of QDs (Qdot 565, invitrogen) was deposited and dried 
on a coverslip and imaged with a standard wide-field microscope 
(100x, 1.4NA) on a CCD camera (64nm pixel-size). We acquired 10^{3}
 frames each with 100 ms exposure time. The total acquisition 
time was about 2 mins. 

The camera pixels values were converted into a photon counts with 
a gain estimated from a calibration measurement.
