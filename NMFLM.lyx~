\begin_layout Plain Layout
Quantum dots are good for microscopy because they are bright and photo-stable.
 LM cant really use them because they are difficult to controle.
 (Some recent publications in LM using QDs.
 Stress that LM is very accessible and cheap.) We try first to separate the
 individual sources and then localise them individually contraty to the
 fitting of the model of the PSF and intentistie to the time data.
 This accomodates the PSF of different shapes as no prior knowledge about
 hte PSF (apart from the non-negativity constraints) are used.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One of the issue is to estimate the number of components in the data.
 As this might result in differnet reconstruction (demonstration).
 Different appraches of the K estimation.
 Compare PCA, BIC, variational LB and correlations in residuals.

) controle transition between these states by photo-switching of the fluorophore
s as they require only one source to be ON within a diffraction limited
 area at a time.
 This is achieved by driving the sample into a state where only a small
 subset of the fluorophores are in ON state.
 The superresolution image is composed from the repetitive localisation
 of the different subsets of individual fluorophores.
 An optimal number of the ON sources in each acquisition frame must experimantal
ly estimated as a high density of the ON fluorophores results in overlapping
 sources that cannot be localised whereas a small density lead to a long
 acquistion time

 However, the stochastic blinking makes QDs impractical for the standard
 LM as the rate of ON-OFF transition is difficult to control.
 This results in highly overlapping sources that cannot be localised with
 standard LM techniques.

Some methods exploiting the blinking behaviour of the QD have been proposed.
 Maximum aposteriori fitting of the positions and the intensities of known
 individual point spread functions (PSFs) into a movie of blinking QD (QD

 It models the movie of blinking QDs as a combination of the individual
 sources with fluctuating intensities.
 Unlike ICA, NMF imposes a natural non-negativity constraints on the images
 of the inidvidual sources and their intensities.
 Moreover, we used a NMF algorith
