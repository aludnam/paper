\begin_layout Title
NMF in LM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
We used non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) as a model for blinking
 quantum dots in microscopic samples.
 This allows us to separate and subsequently localise individual, sources
 with highl overlapping point spread functions (PSFs).
 NMF does not use any prior information about the shape or the blinking
 characteristics of the individual sources.
 Therefore NMF can be used to recover the individual sources from data where
 each emmiters produces a different PSF.
 This situation can, for example, arise in 3D samples where the fluorophores
 are in different focal depths.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Quantum dots are good for microscopy because they are bright and photo-stable.
 LM cant really use them because they are difficult to control.
 (Some recent publications in LM using QDs.
 Stress that LM is very accessible and cheap.) We try first to separate the
 individual sources and then localise them individually contraty to the
 fitting of the model of the PSF and intentistie to the time data.
 This accomodates the PSF of different shapes as no prior knowledge about
 the PSF (apart from the non-negativity constraints) are used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One of the issue is to estimate the number of components in the data.
 As this might result in different reconstruction (demonstration).
 Different approaches of the K estimation.

Localisation microscopy (LM) is a conceptually simple and accessible technique

 the classical resolution limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=\frac{\lambda}{\mbox{2NA}}$

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the wavelength of the emission light and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{NA}$
\end_inset

 is the numerical aperture of the objective lens.
 LM makes use of the fluorophore transition between bright (ON) and dark
 (OFF) states to discriminate individual sources separated by a distance
 
\begin_inset Formula $d<\delta$
\end_inset

.
 The super-resolution image is achieved by a repetitive localisation of
 the different individual spatially separated subsets of fluorophores.
 The optimal number of ON sources in each acquisition frame must be experimental
ly estimated 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 A high density of the ON fluorophores results in overlapping sources and
 complicates localisation whereas a small density leads to a long acquisition
 time.

 Excellent photo-stability, low cyto-toxicity and distinctive spectral propertie

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 However, the stochastic blinking of QDs is impractical for standard LM
 as the rate of ON-OFF transition and hence the density of ON sources is
 difficult to control.
 QD labeled data typically consist of highly overlapping sources which cannot
 be localised with standard LM techniques.

\begin_layout Standard
We used non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lee1999"

\end_inset

 as a natural model for QD data.
 NMF decomposes a movie of the blinking QDs into spatial (time independent
 images of the individual sources) and temporal parts (fluctuating intensities
 of each emitter).
 NMF imposes natural non-negativity constraints on both the spatial (the
 images of the individual sources) and the temporal (intensities) components.
 Moreover, we used the NMF algorithm
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lee2001"

\end_inset

 which maximises the likelihood of the model for data corrupted with Poisson
 noise.
 This makes NMF preferable to ICA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lidke2005"

\end_inset

 for QD data as ICA allows negative entries in the separated components
 and does not account for noise in the measured data (fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Comparison of NMF and ICA"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NMF does not put any additional constraints on the shape (point spread function
 PSF) or blinking behaviour of the individual sources, apart from being
 non-negative.
 Therefore NMF can separate overlapping sources of differing shapes and
 blinking characteristics.
 Variability in PSFs can, for example, arise in a 3D sample where fluorophores
 can be in different focal depths and therefore each exhibiting a different
 PSF.

The NMF algorithm requires prior knowledge about the number of sources 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 to be separated.
 Principal component analysis of the data (PCA) can be used as a simple
 method for dimensionality estimation.
 However, for noisy data the estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is difficult.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results of NMF are the maximum-likelihood estimates and therefore a
 higher 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 leads to a higher likelihood (or a lower residual error) as more sources
 are better able to fit the data.
 However, overestimating 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 produces spurious sources.
 On the other hand, underestimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 results in incorrect source shapes as one component must fit several sources.
 Therefore a reliable estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is vital for a successful separation.

We achieved more reliable

 Models with low

 give rise to residual correlations as multiple individual emitters have
 to be represented with fewer components.
 Correlations decrease with higher 
\begin_inset Formula $K$

 We selected the smallest

Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ability to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 correctly becomes increasingly difficult for closely spaced sources.
 Simulations of the noisy data comprising two QDs show that NMF can reliably
 separate two close emitters (
\begin_inset Formula $d>\delta/10)$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\mbox{ture}}$
\end_inset

 is known (
\begin_inset Formula $K=K_{\mbox{true}}$
\end_inset

).
 However, the high correlations in residuals for 
\begin_inset Formula $K<K_{\mbox{true}}$
\end_inset

 arise only when the two sources are separated at least by 
\begin_inset Formula $d>\delta/5$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=\lambda/2\mbox{NA}$
\end_inset

 is the classical resolution limit (fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Localisation precision and maximum correlations"

\end_inset

).
 The credible estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 determines the actual resolution limit of the method.

A movie of blinking quantum dots can be regarded as an 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times T$

\begin_inset Formula ${\bf D}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of pixels and 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is the number of time frames in the movie.
 Each frame in the movie is transformed into a column of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf D}$
\end_inset

 by concatenating columns of the 2D image into a 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times1$
\end_inset

 vector.
 Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) makes an approximative decomposition
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
{\bf D}\approx{\bf WH},\label{eq:NMF approximative}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times T$

 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf D}$
\end_inset

 is expressed as a multiplication of the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times K$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula ${\bf W}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K\times T$

 The matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{nk}$

 The columns of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf W}$

\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n}w_{nk}=1$

 One component was added as a homogeneous, static background: 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{n(K+1)}=\frac{1}{N}$

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t}d_{nt}$

 This component was not updated over the iterations.
 We run each NMF evaluation with five partial restarts - after each run
 convergence we restarted the values of

\begin_inset Formula $1/\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{nk}h_{kt}}$
\end_inset

 is applied in order to standardise the residuals of Poisson distributed
 data.
 We can then compute the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times N$
\end_inset

 correlation matrix 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bm{C}_{S}=\bm{SS}^{T},
\]

\end_inset

and the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times N$
\end_inset

 matrix of the correlation coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{R}_{S}$
\end_inset

 with entries 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
r_{ij}=\frac{c_{ij}}{\sqrt{c_{ii}c_{jj}}}.\label{eq:Correlation in residuals}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Underestimation of the number of sources (
\begin_inset Formula $K<K_{\mbox{true}}$
\end_inset

) will lead to correlations between some pixels as the model will try to
 explain multiple sources with one component.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $K\geq K_{\mbox{true}}$
\end_inset

 the correlations are expected to drop to a base level and the residuals
 become uncorrelated.
 We can pick up the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $K=\bar{K}$
\end_inset

 for which the residual correlations decrease to a certain level and 
\begin_inset Formula $K>\bar{K}$
\end_inset

 does not give any further imporvement.

\begin_layout Standard
The parameters used for simulations are shown in Table
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The individual QDs were generated as in-focus point-spread functions and
 the intenisty of each source was generated from uniform distribution on
 the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,\, I_{max}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 A uniform constant background was added to each frame and all pixels were
 corrupted with Poisson noise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two different collections of data-sets were created.
 In the first collection we simulated two sources (
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\mbox{true}}=2$
\end_inset

) separated by a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $d=0.1-1.2\mbox{ pixels}$
\end_inset

.
 In the second collection we simulated ten sources (
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\mbox{true}}=10$
\end_inset

) randomly distributed within a circualr area with diameter 
\begin_inset Formula $r=\delta,\,1.5\delta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2\delta$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=\frac{\lambda}{2\mbox{NA}}$
\end_inset

 is the classical resolution limit.
 Each dataset in both collections was generated 10 times with a random geometric
al configuration of the sources.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Localisation error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To asses the localisation performance of NMF we used dataset of two QDs
 (
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\mbox{true}}=2$
\end_inset

) separated by 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 and assumed that the number of sources is known 
\begin_inset Formula $K=K_{\mbox{true}}$
\end_inset

.
 Separated components were localised as a maximum likelihood fit of an isotropic
 2D gaussian with a centre 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{\overline{x}}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 We computed the mean localisation error per separation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon=\frac{1}{d}\frac{e_{1}+e_{2}}{2}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}=\left|\bm{\overline{x}}_{i}-\bm{x}_{i}^{\mbox{true}}\right|$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the localisation error of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th source located at 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{x}_{i}^{true}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d=\left|\bm{x}_{1}^{\mbox{true}}-\bm{x}_{2}^{\mbox{true}}\right|$
\end_inset

 is the true separation of the emitters.
 The estimated 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 for different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is shown as a magenta line in fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Localisation precision and maximum correlations"

\end_inset

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $d>30\mbox{ nm}$
\end_inset

 the mean localisation error is less than 
\begin_inset Formula $20\%$
\end_inset

 of the separation 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon=0.2$
\end_inset

) and is futher decreasing for higher values of 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used the same data (
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\mbox{true}}=2$
\end_inset

) to evaluated the model for 
\begin_inset Formula $K=1,\,2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 and analysed the residual correlations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Correlation in residuals"

\end_inset

.
 The maximum value 
\begin_inset Formula $\max_{i,j}(r_{ij})$
\end_inset

 in the correlation coefficient matrix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Correlation in residuals"

\end_inset

 as a funciton of 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is shown in fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Localisation precision and maximum correlations"

\end_inset

 for the three different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

.
 For closely spaced sources (
\begin_inset Formula $d\leq30\mbox{ nm)}$
\end_inset

 the correlations are approximately on the same level for any 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

.
 However, for 
\begin_inset Formula $d\geq40\mbox{ nm}$
\end_inset

 there is a steep increase of the correlations for 
\begin_inset Formula $K=1$
\end_inset

 (blue line) compared to 
\begin_inset Formula $K=2$
\end_inset

 (green line).
 The model with 
\begin_inset Formula $K=3$
\end_inset

 (red line) does not lead to any further improvement.
 For this noise level we can therefore estimate the correct 
\begin_inset Formula $K=2$
\end_inset

 for emitters separated at least by 
\begin_inset Formula $d>50\mbox{ nm}$
\end_inset

.
 Comparison with the mean localisation precision (magenta line) suggests
 that the correct estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 determines the resolution of the method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dataset with 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\mbox{true}}=10$

 with different densities of the sources (see section simulatd data) has
