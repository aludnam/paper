\begin_layout Plain Layout
Quantum dots are good for microscopy because they are bright and photo-stable.
 LM cant really use them because they are difficult to control.
 (Some recent publications in LM using QDs.
 Stress that LM is very accessible and cheap.) We try first to separate the
 individual sources and then localise them individually contraty to the
 fitting of the model of the PSF and intentistie to the time data.
 This accomodates the PSF of different shapes as no prior knowledge about
 the PSF (apart from the non-negativity constraints) are used.

One of the issue is to estimate the number of components in the data.
 As this might result in different reconstruction (demonstration).

Localisation microscopy (LM) is a conceptually simple and an accessible
 technique providing super-resolution fluorescent images

 The structure of the sample is reconstructed by localising individual fluoropho

 the classical resolution limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=\frac{\lambda}{\mbox{2NA}}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the wavelength of the emmission light and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{NA}$
\end_inset

 is the numerical aperture of the objective lens.
 LM makes use of the fluorophore transition between bright (ON) and dark
 (OFF) states to discriminate individual sources separated by a distance

) control ON-OFF transition by photo-switching of the fluorophores as they
 require only one source to be ON within a diffraction limited area at a
 time.
 This is achieved by driving the sample into a state where only a small
 subset of the fluorophores are in ON state.
 The super-resolution image is composed from the repetitive localisation
 of the different subsets of individual spatially separated fluorophores.
 An optimal number of the ON sources in each acquisition frame must be experimen

 as a small density lead to a long acquisition time whereas a high density
 of the ON fluorophores results in overlapping sources and complicates localizat
ion.
 However, some recent concepts suggest algorithms which can deal with high
 density of the ON sources

 make QDs very attractive for biological research.
 However, the stochastic blinking makes QDs impractical for the standard
 LM as the rate of ON-OFF transition is difficult to control.
 This results in highly overlapping sources that cannot be localised with
 standard LM techniques.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lee1999"

\end_inset

 as a natural model for QD data.
 NMF decomposes spatio-temporal data (a movie of the blinking QDs) into
 spatial components (time independent images of the individual sources)
 and temporal components (fluctuating intensities).
 NMF imposes a natural non-negativity constraints on the images of the individua
l sources (point spread function PSF) and their intensities.
 Moreover, we used a NMF algorithm
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lee2001"

\end_inset

 that maximizes the likelihood of the model for data corrupted with Poisson
 noise.
 This makes NMF a method of choice compared to ICA based approach
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lidke2005"

\end_inset

 which allows negative entries in the separated components and does not
 account for noise in the measured data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NMF does not put any constraints on the shape or blinking behavior of the
 individual sources (apart from being non-negative).
 Therefore NMF can separate overlapping sources each having different shape
 and blinking behavior.
 This can, for example, arise in a 3D sample where fluorophores can be in
 different focal depths and therefore each exhibiting a different PSF.

NMF alogrithm requires a prior knowledge about the number of sources 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 to be separated.
 Principal component analysis of the data (PCA) can be used as a simple
 method for dimensionality estimation.
 However, for noisy data the estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is difficult.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the results of NMF are the maximum-likelihood estimates, the higher 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 leeds to a higher likelihood (or a lower residual error) as more sources
 are better able to fit the data, however, overestimating 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 produces a spurious unrealistic sources.
 On the other hand, an underestimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 results in incorrect source shapes as one component must fit several sources.
 Therefore a reliable estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is vital for a succesfull separation.

\end_inset

 for a given data set 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf D}$
\end_inset

 - the posterior probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p(K|{\bf D})$
\end_inset

.
 We can then choose the 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 which maximizes this quantity.
 However, a test on simulated data suggests that this approach systematicaly
 underestimates 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We achieved more reliable estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 by analysing the residuals data-model.
 Underestimateion of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 gives rise to correlations in certains areas of the image as several individual
 emmiters are explained by a single component.
 The correlatins in residuals should drop to a base level for a model with
 at least 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\mbox{true}}$
\end_inset

 sources.
 A slight overestimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 does not lead to any further significant improvement.
 We can then select the 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 where the last significant drop appears.

\begin_inset Formula ${\bf D}$

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is a number of time frames in the movie.
 Each frame in the movie is transformed into a column of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf D}$
\end_inset

 by concatenating columns of the 2D image into a

A different approach to estimating the number of components

\end_inset

 is to analyse the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times T$
\end_inset

 residual matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{S}$
\end_inset

 (entries 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{xt}$

 After evaluating the model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:NMF relaxed"

\end_inset

 for different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

, we compute a standartised residual matrix with entries 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{nt}=\frac{d_{nt}-\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{nk}h_{kt}}{\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{nk}h_{kt}}}.
\]

\end_inset

The factor 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{nk}h_{kt}}$
\end_inset

 is applied in order to standardise the residuals of Poisson distributed
 data.
 We can then compute the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times N$
\end_inset

 correlation matrix 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bm{C}_{S}=\bm{SS}^{T},
\]

\end_inset

and the

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Underestimation of the number of sources (
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 too small) will lead to correlations between some pixels as the model will
 try to explain multiple sources by one component.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $K=K$
\end_inset

 the correlations are expected to decrease until we reach a sufficient number
 of sources to explain the data and the residuals become uncorrelated.
